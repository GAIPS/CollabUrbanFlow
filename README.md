# Collaborative Urban Flow (CUF)

Is a set of reinforcement learning based adaptive traffic signal control systems.

# Core Principles

- Muh (minimalism):
    - Less frameworks as possible.
    - No. Reinforcement learning is not deep reinforcement learning.
    - The python should approximate a papers' pseudocode.
- Data interfaces: 
    - Data wrangling: preprocessing, saving, loading and transforming is certain.
    - For code consuming and producing data to behave in predictable ways. Data should have formal interfaces.
    - Hard data interfaces constrain the loose nature of Muh. 
- When in doubt follow UNIX: 
    - Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
    - Interactive use instead of batch processing.
    - Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
